# CS2-AI-Bot
This project is a real-time YOLOv8-based triggerbot for CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) with an integrated recoil pattern. It uses computer vision to automatically detect enemies and fires only when your crosshair is aligned, simulating human reaction with configurable aim assist and recoil compensation.
